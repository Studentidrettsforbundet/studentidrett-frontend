components that are shared between multiple pages

## Standards
Each component is stored in its own directory, alongside files with helper-functions or smaller components used only in that component. A styles.ts-file to contain non-universal styling is also in the same directory. Styling that is done universally (e.g. colors, text etc.) is to be placed in the styles-folder in /src.
